ICGRNN: Input Convex Graph Recurrent Neural Networks
A PyTorch implementation of Input Convex Graph Recurrent Neural Networks for optimal control problems and node classification.
⚠️ Important Note for Implementation
To run the implementation, please use the notebooks/exp.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
While the rest of the codebase is structured according to proper Python package conventions, there are currently some import resolution issues with the standalone scripts. The notebook contains a fully functional implementation that you can run without these issues.
Features

Input convexity guarantees for global optimality
Graph-based spatiotemporal modeling
Applications to heat diffusion control and node classification
