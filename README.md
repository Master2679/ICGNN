# Input Convex Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (ICGRNN)

**A sophisticated implementation of Input Convex Graph Neural Networks with novel applications to temporal graph dynamics and heat diffusion modeling.**

## üß† Overview

This project implements **Input Convex Graph Recurrent Neural Networks**, combining three cutting-edge machine learning paradigms:
- **Input Convex Neural Networks** (mathematical convexity constraints)
- **Graph Neural Networks** (spatial relationship modeling)  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks** (temporal dynamics)

### Key Innovation
The architecture maintains **mathematical convexity** throughout the network while modeling complex graph dynamics over time, enabling guaranteed optimization properties and interpretable predictions.

## üî¨ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**1. Convex Layer Implementation**
```python
class ConvexLayer(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        # Ensure convexity with non-negative weights
        return F.linear(x, F.relu(self.weight), self.bias)
```

**2. Graph Convex Message Passing**
- Degree-normalized message aggregation
- Convexity-preserving weight constraints
- Skip connections for gradient flow

**3. Recurrent Convex Updates**
- Temporal state evolution with convex constraints
- Multi-step prediction capability
- Memory-efficient sequential processing

### Mathematical Foundation

The network ensures **input convexity** by constraining all weights to be non-negative:
```
f(Œ±x‚ÇÅ + (1-Œ±)x‚ÇÇ) ‚â§ Œ±f(x‚ÇÅ) + (1-Œ±)f(x‚ÇÇ)
```

This mathematical property guarantees:
- **Global optimization** properties
- **Interpretable gradients**
- **Stable training dynamics**
