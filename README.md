# ICGRNN: Input Convex Graph Recurrent Neural Networks

A **PyTorch implementation** of Input Convex Graph Recurrent Neural Networks for:
- Optimal control problems
- Node classification

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note for Implementation

To run the implementation, **please use the `notebooks/exp.ipynb` Jupyter notebook**.

- While the rest of the codebase follows proper Python package conventions, there are **currently some import resolution issues** with the standalone scripts.
- The notebook contains a **fully functional implementation** that can be executed without these issues.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Input convexity guarantees** for global optimality  
- ‚úÖ **Graph-based spatiotemporal modeling**  
- ‚úÖ Applications to:
  - Heat diffusion control  
  - Node classification
